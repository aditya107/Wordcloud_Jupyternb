# Wordcloud_Jupyternb

In this project we will be creating a Word cloud out of any text that we provide to the program in a file.
To test this try using an extract from you favourite novel, book etc. (To get interesting Wordclouds out of this please try using large text files)
This project is compatible with Jupyter notebooks.
